                    <p>HTML5<mark> (Hypertext Markup Language 5)</mark> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the
                    World Wide Web.<br> It was the fifth and final major HTML version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
                    recommendation.<br> The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.</p>

                <aside>
                    <P>HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"
                    status in October 2014.<br>[5][6] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
                    new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
                    such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.<br>
                    HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML1 and even the DOM Level 2 HTML itself.[7]</P>
